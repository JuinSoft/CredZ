## Project Vision
A decentralized lending platform that enables users to borrow and lend funds based on their on-chain credit score.

### Detailed Description
CredZ is a decentralized lending platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to request loans and lend funds to others based on their credit score, which is dynamically calculated using on-chain activity.

#### Key Features:
1. **Borrowing:** Users can request loans by specifying the amount and duration. The interest rate is determined by their credit score.
2. **Lending:** Lenders can browse available loan requests and choose to fund them. Higher credit scores indicate lower risk.
3. **Credit Scores:** Each user has a credit score that is updated based on their lending and borrowing activity. Repaying loans on time increases the score, while defaults lower it.
4. **Decentralization:** The platform operates through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and eliminating the need for intermediaries.
5. **Security:** Funds are held in escrow by the smart contract until the loan is repaid or defaulted.

### Technologies Used:
- React for the frontend
- Solidity for smart contracts
- Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Covalent API for data aggregation

By providing a transparent and accessible lending market, CredZ aims to democratize access to credit and enable more efficient allocation of capital.
